## Description
This project is a static comp challenge made only with CSS and HTML. The design is based on a [provided comp](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/M2-static-comp-challenge.html) with creative license in copy, colors, fonts, images, and icons. 

My design is meant to imitate an internal company's employee learning portal where employees may work through mandatory training on topics such as risk management, sexual harassment awareness and diversity & sensitivty training as well as other topics like Excel skills, financial planning, etc.
